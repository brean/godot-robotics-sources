# Godot Robotics
Ideas, Sources, Links and Information on using the [Godot Game Engine](https://godotengine.org/) in Robotics.

## Use cases
### Simulation
There is already some very advanced and open source Robotics simulation systems out there, for example [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) or [MARS](https://github.com/rock-simulation/mars), but its always good to have alternatives.

### Create User interfaces for Web and other devices
Godot is already used in the industry for exactly that, but documented use-cases and tutorials for beginners are missing.

## Benefits from using Godot in Robotics
- Fast and realistic \[[1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bgw7crtOcQ)\]\[[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q2SQvfKAiY)\] 3D Graphics including lighting (especially with Godot 4 - important for Robot Perception/Computer Vision training) using SDFGI and HDDAGI.
- Interfaces for different physics engines, an own physics engine as another alternative for bullet/ODE in MARS/Gazebo/pybullet.
- HTML5-export to create robot control user interfaces on modern mobile devices
- A scripting language to easily interface with the enviroment that is also very good documented (GDScript / C#), existing programming documentation
  - allows the implementation of complex behavior without the need of additional dependencies (non-robotic actors, think of for example workers in a production scenario). The [actor-plugin](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=actor&cat=build_robot) for Gazebo could be used to realize something like that, but its not as integrated as the scripting tools provided by Godot, a simulated actor in Godot could have an internal state-machine and switch between different animations easily, this does not exist in Gazebo (yet?).
- Multiple importers for 3D-Models and animations with an existing store, so its easy to let an entity in the simulation be controlled by a human (for example use the [Open 3D Mannequin](https://github.com/GDquest/godot-3d-mannequin))
- VR/AR integration

## Existing Software
- [**Godot-Sim**](https://github.com/plaans/gobot-sim) - a simple 2D robot simulator for Godot, also implementing jobshop for planning
- [**ROS Websocket interface for godot**](https://github.com/rudyvic/ROS-Websocket) - an interface to use the ROS WebSuite
- [**Godot ROS pcviz**](https://github.com/ymd-stella/godot_ros_pcviz) loads and visualize recorded bag-files
- [**Godot ROS**](https://github.com/flynneva/godot_ros) rclcpp (ROS2) example implementation to connect to a ROS2-node from within Godot using C++
- [**URoboSim**](https://github.com/urobosim/URoboSim): ROS-Plugin for Unreal (as inspiration?)
- [**GodotAIGym**](https://github.com/lupoglaz/GodotAIGym/): GodotAIGym for an OpenAI Gym integration.

## Physics simulation
~~Godot 3 uses Bullet, Godot 4 uses bullet and an owen Physics engine~~ Starting with Godot 4.4 the [Jolt Physics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) engine is fully integrated in Godot which is already quite versatile. It might be a good idea to combine [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/) with Godot, like [URoboViz](https://github.com/HoangGiang93/URoboViz).

## What's missing?
- an importer for URDF and SDF for Gazebo models (https://app.ignitionrobotics.org/fuel/models) and .world files
  - you can import models into Blender using [Phobos](https://github.com/dfki-ric/phobos) and then export to OBJ or FBX and import in Gazebo but a direct import would be nice
  - see also: [Loading model files at runtime](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/24768)
- an importer for MARS
  - a mars .scene-file ist just some XML representation of some nodes inside an .scn-file which is just a complressed list of 3D Meshes (obj-files) - should be easy for Godot to parse and load.
- an interface similar to Gazebo
  - the default Node-based Gazebo-interface is already close
- ROS-Godot interface that allows to create ros-nodes from GDScript (ideally from both, the web suite and ROS directly so we can run a heavy simulation locally but also a user interface form a web browser where both have a similar API and both run in Godot?)
- documentation specifically for robotics / a "robotics bundle" or general entrypoint for robotics enthusiasts
  - real-live examples!
  - Demo scenes and more robots!
